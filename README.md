# Investigating-Bike-Share

## Overview

The "Investigating Bike Share" capstone project is designed to apply the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the Coursera Data Analytics course. Through a comprehensive examination of a real-world dataset, this project seeks to answer essential questions and shed light on various aspects of bike sharing, including the kind of people who cycle the most, preferred bike types, favored months for rides, and ride durations.
## Dataset Overview:

Title: Cyclistic Bike Share

Source: Kaggle
Description: The dataset contains information related to bike-sharing usage and includes a variety of data points such as user information, ride timestamps, ride duration, ride details, and more.
Key Features and Columns:

## Project Goals

1. **Understanding User Demographics:** We delve into the dataset to identify the demographic characteristics of users who are most active in bike sharing. This analysis aids in profiling our primary user base.

2. **Preferred Bike Types:** By exploring the types of bikes chosen by riders, we uncover which bikes are most commonly utilized, informing resource allocation and maintenance strategies.

3. **Seasonal Riding Patterns:** We investigate the seasonality of bike sharing to pinpoint the preferred months for rides. This information is instrumental in event planning and resource management.

4. **Ride Duration Analysis:** We conduct an in-depth analysis of ride durations, calculating the average time for a bike ride. These insights guide operational planning and assist in scheduling races and marathons.

## Skills Demonstrated
